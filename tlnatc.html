          <p style="color:white">Tempomancy, or the magic of the control over time, came into existence when the god of time was felled during the Betrayal of Man, and since has taken Kaz Ranar by storm due to its apparent utility. </p>

          <p style="color:white">Following the Flood of Chaos, many people, creatures, and previously mundane items were found to have been altered in new and exciting ways, depending on who you ask. As time passed, these oddities became staples of Kaz Ranaran life. </p>

        <div class="leftcolumn">
          <h2 style="color:#3e38eb"><u>THE AUGUR</u></h2>
          <p style="width:80%;margin:auto;color:white;">In the wake of the Flood of Chaos, there existed a need for the realm's understanding of magic to be rebuilt, as many colleges and mages were lost in the apocalypse. Rising to the challenge, the Arcane Reclaimants pioneered the art of the augur: an elemental researcher role that draws upon a broad knowledge of fundamental forces to augment their magical and martial acuity. By utilizing elemental fire, water, air, earth, and aether, they can conjure enhancing effects and even shape elemental beings to fight for them, all without needing traditional magic. Attune yourself to the heavens and open the gateway to your ascension! </p>

          <p style="color:white;width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">This book also includes four 'Primordial Epithet' subclasses for the Augur: Epithet of Charms, Epithet of Awakening, Epithet of Enhancement, and Epithet of Wielding. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rightcolumn">
          <h2 style="color:#fcba77"><u>THE KNIGHT</u></h2>
          <p style="width:80%;margin:auto;color:white;">Following the Flood of Chaos, what peoples remained commonly found themselves without superiors to follow, or laws to adhere to. Before the realm could devolve into anarchy and chaos, however, the Knights of the Yellow Banner rose to become that guiding hand for many, with many following in their example in ages to come. Knights are paragons of stalwartness, with minds carefully honed into strategic machines. They are the definition of mind over matter, drawing upon their ability to influence those around them to fight through anything. Adopt an icon to represent your potential! </p>
          <p style="color:white;width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">This book also includes four 'Symbolic Will' subclasses for the Knight:
            Icon of Hope, Icon of Knowledge, Icon of Solidarity, and Icon of Vengeance. </p>

                    <p style="width:80%;margin:auto;color:white;">Known for the enigmatic nature of their history and population, the Tenebrel were the aquatic rulers of the world in a bygone age until conflict from within prompted the gods to divide their number into the races of modernity. Many of those who escaped this would seek the downfall of civilization, and eventually indirectly cause the Betrayal of Man and the Flood of Chaos. Some few, however, denounced their race's role in this, and instead use their unique separation from divinity for other, more positive ends. </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="tricolumn">

                    <p style="width:80%;margin:auto;color:white;">Originating from a lower level of reality that came into existence as an antithesis to the Material Plane following the death of a god, the Aeternals are magical constructs in all but name, acting as mirror-images to beings in Material that exist or have existed. Growing self-determination amongst their ranks, however, has lead to some breaching the barrier between worlds, leading to their first discoveries of the decayed realm of Chorus as it is beyond the bounds of their limited reality. </p>

                  <p style="width:80%;margin:auto;color:white;">Previously created by the druid sect that occupies the far southwest of Kaz Ranar, the plantformed proles that were the Andala were granted hitherto-unintended intelligence and awareness as a result of the Flood, causing them to splinter off from their masters and occupy the realm at large. Though their presence has been a boon for many communities they find themselves a part of, they find it difficult to feel at home anywhere but the forests from whence they originated... especially due to innate distrust from the established races. </p>

                    <h1 style="color:white;">THE FLOOD OF CHAOS</h1>
                    <p style="color:white;">It was the 523rd year of the Era of Heavens, the first age of true prosperity and peace across Chorus time of great peace and prosperity across the world of Chorus after the tumult that accompanied the fall of the old superpowers.</p>
                    <p style="color:white;">The conditions were prime for the colonial powers of Kaz Ranar to fully establish their rule, and a golden age had finally been realized. However, not all the native races of Chorus cared for the health of their world in the same way as others. Beings whose number predated civilization felt as if the feats of modern mankind were built upon their backs, an injustice which they felt was directly related to their having been separated from divinity shortly after their conception.</p>
                    <p style="color:white;">These beings, known as the Tenebrel, once worked from the shadows in an attempt to re-establish their old divine rule. However, when it became clear that their efforts would never be able to outpace those they were attempting to overthrow, some sects among them began to turn toward potentially destructive methods. Namely, an artifact leftover from the creation of the planes was once entrusted to them by the divine pantheon, though they were unable to use it due to their separation from divinity. In order to ensure their plan could reach fruition, they would need to find a member of mankind both with the means to learn it’s working and the zeal to wield its power to its full extent…</p>
                    <p style="color:white;">This man would be Zeochad Jahkinruket, the then-Merchant Prince of Ven Totus. With his existing wealth and desire to accrue more making him a perfect candidate, the artifact was thrust into his possession, under the guise of a heroic request to free them from a great beast who had enslaved them. Zeochad would at first wield this power against this oppressor, the dragon Veltana, consort of the noble Jjevelta, but soon his control over his newfound power grew beyond his own means, and his efforts would spiral beyond that of opposing the dragon, with his gradual transformation creeping into his other affairs until he could be considered more of a demigod than a man. </p>
                    <p style="color:white;">Eventually, the pantheon would see fit to intervene, fearing an overturning of the status quo of the world and seeking to reclaim the wayward power that Jahkinruket commanded. By this time, however, the primordial strength the once-mortal man brandished was great, and with it he was able to directly contest the agents of divinity, if but barely. Before he could cement his rule, he would brandish this power against Veltana to complete his end of the bargain with the Tenebrel. However, in a desperate bid to prevent their mistake from leading to further loss of life, Arkhon, the god of time, would stand between the two and attempt to bind his power. That which Jahkinruket commanded was too great compared to a single deity, however, and with one mighty blow he would tear straight through the First One, sundering it wholly and shattering the pantheon that had tied the world together.</p>
                    <p style="color:white;">All at once, causality and the fabric of the plane would come undone, putting the structure of the universe into question. Primordial chaos, previously warded against by the combined efforts of the gods, would sweep through the Material Plane, bringing the world low. Deaths were countless as the nations of Kaz Ranar struggled and failed to maintain order, and nature itself would wither upon the tide. And as the broken body of Arkhon fell to the world below, the magic that was unleashed would suffuse itself into all that remained, causing a turbulence that only the most powerful arcanists could find shelter from.</p>
                    <h2 style="color:white;">This event came to be known as the Flood of Chaos, and the world would never be the same.</h2>
                    <p style="color:white;">In the midst of it all, the leader of the pantheon saw an opportunity to prevent the undoing of creation, digging itself into the fabric of Material, almost becoming part of the plane as an eternal stitch to hold it together. The remaining gods would chase Jahkinruket into the heavens, both to bring him low by any means available to them and to escape the shame of their failure to protect their charges… none of them ever being seen again.</p>
                    <p style="color:white;">Eventually the Flood would subside as the gaping wound in divinity scabbed over, allowing the few who remained of the races of mankind to emerge from hiding. They would find their world changed, withered and decayed and mutated by disorder and bereft of the deific influence that had guided life since its inception. A dark era of silence would begin as these dregs of civilization would work to retake what they lost.</p>
                    <p style="color:white;">Not all was hopelessness, however, as the destruction would give way to new opportunity. The magic that was released with the death of Arkhon would eventually settle into forms that mortals would make use of, and though Jahkinruket took much of the realm’s divinity with him when he absconded to the higher planes, many still held hope that the gods could still hear their cries, and that one day they would return to restore the world, and the pantheon, from their ashes.</p>
                    <p style="color:white;">Eras would pass, and Chorus would slowly rise again to see a new dawn. The great vacuums of power left in the wake of the Betrayal of Man would become prime targets for those seeking to impose new order, including the ones who masterminded the fall from the start. Who will claim the ashes of the old world? </p>

                    <h1 style="color:white;">THE REALM OF KAZ RANAR</h1>
                    <p style="color:white;">Chorus, a realm of vast oceans hugging empty islands full of ruins, tends to have the majority of its activity in rebuilding the realm of Kaz Ranar. A beacon of opportunity amidst the endless waves and veiled seas, it is a prime place for players in Chorus to start their campaign. </p>
                    <p style="color:white;">In the deserts of Oria, sandstorms swirl and move as if they have a mind of their own. Pirate fleets prowl the Kazan Sea searching for their next plunder. Great beasts, under the protection of the Jjevelta, roam the wilds of the land that continue to push back against what remains of the civilized world. Merchants and martial alike become kin to uncover the secrets of the dying realm. The isles of Kaz Ranar are as diverse in geography as they are in people, with almost every climate and culture having representation. </p>
                    <p style="color:white;">North of the burning and ashen mountains lie the lands of Imaran. From their humble beginnings as separatists from the merchant rule that spawned the Betrayer Lord, the many tributaries of the area they settled made it almost fated that a seafaring superpower would arise. With their trade and transport fleets, Imaran finds itself in constant competition for economic supremacy over the realm. </p>
                    <p style="color:white;">South of the mountains, the Alda Desert stretches on to the horizon, miles and miles of bleak, dismal barrens. Yet amidst it all may be the grandest magical power that Chorus has ever known: Absi'teset. As the oldest nation on Kaz Ranar, its history is as grandiose as the power they claim to wield, and the majority of its citizenry are magically adept due to the way the nation is structured. </p>
                    <p style="color:white;">Yet further south is a lush area known as the Kaiden Wood, housing an independent city state and the lush paradise upon which it is dependent. The druidic elves who broke off from Absi'teset in the early days of the Era of Settlement saw the lands below as a place of great potential, believing it to be the area where the god of nature housed itself; a place known now as the World Bloom, a massive flower-like landmark that is now the center of Kazy'xe as it is today. </p>
                    <p style="color:white;">Across the Kazan Sea on the landmass of Dencornar, Norimar was once the largest nation in Kaz Ranar. Atop a wealth of natural resources and valuable minerals, the nation quickly grew from a small band of rebels attempting to protect themselves from imperial retribution to what may be the largest economic and military powerhouse on all of Chorus, still attempting to strike a balance between progress and tradition in spite of this power. </p>
                    <p style="color:white;">In the southern half of Dencornar, the Nexari Wilds continue to go untouched by the nations of mankind. Beneath the boughs exist numerous tribes that were brought under the protection of a brass dragon who acted as the spokesperson for, the protector of, and the mediator of these tribes. This formed a sort of proto-nation that now goes under the name of Jjevelta, named after the dragon who formed it, working to prevent the spreading influence of mankind from doing further damage to their lives.</p>
                    <p style="color:white;">On the faraway island of the same name, the plutocratic empire of Ven Totus was born from the crucible of conflict within the dwarven heartland. From a struggle between orderly and free society, the merchant republic was born, with its first leader using vast resources to sway those who remained to follow them. Since then, Ven Totus has spread across Chorus, and seeks to overtake the economies of Kaz Ranar just as it did in many other places in the past, though political strife and their hand in the rise of the Betrayer Lord has made such efforts unfeasible in recent years.</p>
