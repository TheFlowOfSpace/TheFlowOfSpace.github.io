                        In the wake of the Astral Flood, there existed a need for the realm's understanding of magic to be rebuilt, as many colleges and mages were lost in the apocalypse. Rising to the challenge, arcanists are researchers of the multiverse, drawing upon a broad knowledge of reality to channel new powers to augment their magical and martial acuity. By drawing upon otherworldly energies, they can draw on powers of higher planes, summoning enhancing effects and even drawing forth otherworldly allies to fight for them

                        This book also includes four subclasses for the Arcanist:
                        Evoker, Illusionist, Enchanter, and Abjurer.

                        Following the Astral Flood, what peoples remained commonly found themselves without superiors to follow, or laws to adhere to. Before the realm could devolve into anarchy and chaos, however, the knights rose to become that guiding hand for many. Knights are paragons of reliability and stalwartness, with minds carefully honed into strategic and logistical machines. They are the definition of mind over matter, drawing upon their sheer willpower and ability to influence those around them to fight through any challenge.

                        <div style="margin-top:10px"></div>
                        Previously created by the exile druid sect that occupied the far southwest of Kaz Ranar, the plantformed proles that were the Andala were granted hitherto-unintended intelligence and awareness as a result of the Flood, causing them to splinter off from their masters and occupy the realm at large. Though their presence has been a boon for many communities they find themselves a part of, they find it difficult to feel at home anywhere but the forests from whence they originated... especially due to innate distrust from the established races.

                        <div style="margin-top:10px"></div>
                        Originating from a lower level of reality that came into existence as an antithesis to the Material Plane following the Astral FLood, the Aeternals are magical constructs in all but name, acting as mirror-images to beings in Material that exist or have existed. Growing self-determination amongst their ranks, however, has lead to some breaching the barrier between worlds, leading to their first discoveries of the decaying realm of Chorus as it is beyond the bounds of their limited reality.

                        Known for the enigmatic nature of their history and population, the Tenebrel were the aquatic rulers of the world in a bygone age, using an affinity for flesh-shaping and magical manipulation to govern the races landbound from waterlogged palaces and godly domains. Though the vast majority of their number became Humans when their empire fell and the magic sustaining them faltered, a select few were lucky enough to be graced by the gods to retain their aquatic forms... and snooty demeanor.

                            By sheer luck, these halflings were able to dig their heels in and simply wait out the Flood, before rising to meet the new world.

                        Tempomancy, or the magic of temporal control, has taken Kaz Ranar by storm due to its apparent utility in the process of reconstruction. It only came into existence following the Flood and subsequent sundering of the world.

                        Following the Astral Flood, many people, creatures, and previously mundane items were found to have been altered in new and exciting ways, depending on who you ask. As time passed, these oddities became staples of Kaz Ranaran life.

                <h1 style="font-size:50px;">THE ASTRAL FLOOD</h1>
                <div id="pinch">
                    It was the 523rd year of the Era of Harmony.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    Dwarven war machines from the east rumbled across the grasslands of Orinar. Their destination was in sight on the horizon: The magical wellspring of power within the foreign capitol city of Absiet, nestled between the gently sloping hills of the Alda Plains. With the great strength they would derive from it, their nations' influence would surely become uncontestable, allowing them to assert themselves as the de-facto superpower of Kaz Ranar, and perhaps all of Chorus.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    However, though they marched for the city with heavy footfalls with their intent to conquer and annex the area clear to all across the realm, they find no resistance as they tread ever closer to the gates of the mages' city.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    Though it seemed plausible to an outside observer that the residents of Absiet had laid down to accept their fate, they had, in reality, been working tirelessly to craft a magical weapon capable of harnessing the full potential of their magical well. With it, they intended to drain the determination and willpower from the invading armies, leading to their surrender or retreat, granting the mages time to sue for peace using their newfound bargaining chip.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    However, as the drums of war sounded upon their doorstep, they lacked the time to test their creation properly. With breath bated across the nation, their masterpiece activated, and a wave of wild magic consumed all that could be seen.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    The power dwelling beneath the ground of Chorus was more primal and powerful than originaly thought, and with the mages' bid for supremacy this power was allowed to manifest in the world at large, freed from the ley lines within which it was previously bound. A chain reaction began which would drown the world in searing arcane power.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    This event came to be known as the Astral Flood, and the world would never be the same.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    Workers and citizens across the realm, unaware of the nature of the war, dropped dead in their fields and on their workbenches. Nature withered as trees turned to ash upon the tide of magic, and the very land itself cracked and splintered under the pressure of this immense power as if it were glass, or perhaps wood rapidly drying, aging, and rotting. Civilizations the world over were brought to their knees, with only those lucky enough to be far enough from a ley line or be somehow shielded from ground zero surviving to see the dawn.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    However, mankind would not see itself consigned to oblivion just yet. Though the vast majority of the world's peoples were felled seemingly overnight, they would rise again to rebuild in a following era of reconstruction. Nations once again rose from the ashes to find the world around them drained of life, vastly changed by the magic that had washed over the realm. Their peoples found themselves contending with beasts altered by the untold power, wielding new magics derived from unforseen research, and seeing new worlds beyond previously mundane barriers.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    Though the gods had long left the realm to its own fate, Chorus rises again to a new dawn against all odds. Will its inhabitants ever fully recover from the consequences of their own hubris?

                <h1 style="font-size:50px">THE REALM OF KAZ RANAR</h1>
                <div id="pinch">
                    Chorus, a realm of vast oceans hugging empty islands full of ruins, tends to have the majority of its activity in rebuilding the realm of Kaz Ranar. A beacon of opportunity amidst the endless waves and veiled seas, it is a prime place for players in Chorus to start their campaign.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    In the deserts of Orinar, sandstorms swirl and move as if they have a mind of their own. Pirate fleets prowl the Kazan Sea searching for their next plunder. Great beasts, under the protection of the Jjevelta, roam the wilds of the land that continue to push back against what remains of the civilized world. The Crash and the drained landscapes of the Misshapen Isles are home to monsters and mankind alike. The isles of Kaz Ranar are as diverse in geography as they are in people, with almost every climate having representation. This section will provide an overview of the various geographical features one may find in Kaz Ranar.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    Above the Burning and Ashen Walls lie the lands of Imaran. From their humble beginnings in the ashes of a fallen orc pirate rule, the many tributaries of the area made it almost fated that a seafaring nation would arise. With their trade and transport fleets, Imaran finds itself in constant competition with Ven Eldara for economic supremacy over the realm. Of the two, many denizens of the realm say they prefer Imaran merchants, but higher quality also equals higher prices… especially in a time of conflict such as now. 
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    South of the burning wall, the Alda Desert stretches on to the horizon, miles and miles of bleak, dismal sand. Yet amidst it all may be the grandest magical power that Chorus has ever known: Absi'teset. As the oldest nation on Kaz Ranar, its history is as grandiose as the power they claim to wield, and the majority of its citizenry are magically adept due to the way the nation is structured. However, the hostile eyes cast upon them from the rest of the realm due to the part they played in the Era of Sundering may be an indicator of hostilities to come.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    Below the Alda Desert is a lush area known as the Kaiden Wood, housing a libertarian wonderland within a natural paradise. The druidic elves who broke off from Absi'teset in the early days of the Era of Settlement saw the lands below as a place of great magical potential, believing it to be an area where direct communion with gods was possible; a place known now as the World Bloom, a massive flower-like landmark that is now the center of Kazy'xe as it is today.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    Occupying the majority of Dencornar, Norimar was once the largest nation in Kaz Ranar. Atop a wealth of natural resources and valuable minerals, the nation quickly grew from a small band of rebels attempting to protect themselves from imperial retribution to what may be the largest economic and military powerhouse on all of Chorus, still attempting to coexist with the Jjevelta and others in spite of this power. However, they likely suffered the worst from the Great Sundering, and had to rebuild their empire from absolute scratch in its wake.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    In the southern half of Dencornar, the Nexari Wilds continue to go untouched by the nations of mankind. Beneath the boughs exist numerous tribes that, in the wake of the Era of Settlement, were brought under the protection of a brass dragon who acted as the spokesperson for, the protector of, and the mediator of these tribes. This formed a sort of proto-nation that now goes under the name of Jjevelta, named after the dragon who formed it.
                    <div style="margin-top:25px"></div>
                    On the faraway island of the same name, the plutocratic empire of Ven Eldara was born from the crucible of conflict within the dwarven heartland. From a struggle between orderly and free society, the plutocracy was born, with its first leader using vast resources to sway those who remained to follow them. Since then, the heartland of Ven Eldara was drained dry of natural resources and life, and with the Era of Sundering in Kaz Ranar that threatened to sink Ven Totus into the ocean, massive dwarven seedships have hopped from island to island, working them down in kind. Kaz Ranar is the first that has offered significant resistance.
