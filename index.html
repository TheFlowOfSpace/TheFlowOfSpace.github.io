    <h2 style="text-align:center">Update 1: A Rebranding</h2>
    <h5 style="text-align:center">Some Much Needed Changes</h5>

    
    <p>Hi! It's been a while. A good, long while. Going on half of a year, actually.</p>
    <p>I apologize for the extreme lack of updates on my part--frankly unacceptable behavior from someone trying to get people excited about a product, huh? I sincerely apologize to anyone still around waiting for updates (don't worry, I'll be getting back into the swing of things starting with this post).</p>
    <p>There was a bit of a spell where there was some really weird mental health stuff going on on my end; another (entirely unrelated) project of mine ended up being shelved for the time being because I just needed some time to settle into my new job and get the spiders out of my head. But the whole time, I've still been working on the book...</p>
    <p>...although when I start showing you things, you might find that it's in a bit of a different state than you might remember.</p>
    <p>As I continued to work on the book, I was somewhat dissatisfied with how things were coming together. The scope was too large, the overarching themes a bit too vague. As I mused, it started to feel to me like the whole setting was just dressing; an excuse for me to get the mechanical aspects of the book out in a fashion that I felt like people might be interested in. And as I continued to think and muse, I decided that wasn't how I wanted my beautiful child of a literary work to enter the world in.</p>
    <p>I've been experimenting with other ideas on how to have the setting better stand on its own, including sweeping changes to the setting and overall theme. One that has gained traction among personal confidants is (working title) <b>Chorus: A Navigator's Account of the New World</b>. The current setting of Kaz Ranar is made much larger (the 'old world') and set off as a background location, and the focus of the book instead takes place in a region of a recently-discovered continent named 'Alto', wherein old world powers attempt to gain a foothold (out of necessity, there's a bit of a resource shortage in the old world which rings similar bells to the Flood of Chaos in the old book concept) in the face of adversity from hostile environments, creatures, and native populations.</p>
    <p>Personally, I like the direction that the change in setting is going--the constricted scope makes every location much more impactful, while the change to a colonial setting still allows the diverse host of cultures I wrote to still have a place. The more mechanical parts of the book are mostly unchanged, though some minor things needed to be retooled as the lack of apocalypse meant that there wasn't really a need for a bunch of grimdark edgelord subclasses. I'm open to critique and ideas regarding the new setting; I'm not sure how many of you showed up specifically for the post-apocalyptic setting, but I'm hoping to fit as much of what I had before into the new setting.</p>
    <p>Of course, I'll need to throw together new promotional material whenever I decide on a title (open to suggestions by the way), and of course the page on the website is going to be a pain to redo, but hopefully the changes I'm writing ease my concerns over the setting being 'wide as an ocean, shallow as a puddle'.</p>
    <p>With this update, I'll be getting back into my weekly schedule, as well as contuing to work on promoting the project to hopefully get more activity into the Discord. Thank you so much for continuing to stick around! I won't promise a date as of now for an updated Kickstarter campaign, but as always, you'll be the first to know.</p>
    <p>I'll leave you for now with two descriptions of new backgrounds I've added to the book as part of the rewrite.</p>
    <p><a href="arcanist.PNG" target="_blank">The Arcanist background. Researchers of magic and the multiverse with a penchant for recognizing more subtle arcane influences.</a></p>
    <p><a href="newblood.PNG" target="_blank">The Newblood background. No life experience prior to their adventure, but a powerful potential that provides unique opportunities.</a></p>
