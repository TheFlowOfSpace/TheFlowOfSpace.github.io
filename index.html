    <h2 style="text-align:center">Update 4: Premade Characters</h2>
    <h5 style="text-align:center">Adventurers in the New World</h5>
    <p>In my experiences playing and running D&D games (and especially one-shots), you'll have the occasional player who doesn't want to go through the whole shabang of character creation and occasionally just want to just pick up a premade and go. Which is understandable! And of course, premade characters provide an opportunity to give players story hooks that they might otherwise be ignorant of, without spoiling too much of the story. Another reason to have them is as examples for players who wish to make use of new features in the book, but don't know exactly how to fit them into a build.</p>
    <p>At the end of Chapter 1, I have a set of eight character sheets of premade characters, each utilizing a new class, subclass, race, or background found in the book. Some short descriptions of them:</p>
    <p><b>Ath Yiedrel</b> is a <b>glass half-elf Disorder Domain cleric</b> of Arkhon who was <b>exiled </b> from the magocratic Absi'teset due to being one of many unfortunate enough to inherit the Curse of Glass. After witnessing the deaths of his own parents and feeling his connection to the divine falter as a result, he travels to the new world hoping to find distant relatives or new friends beyond the reach of Tesetian oppression, only to find them attempting to repeat the mistake that created the Curse in the first place.</p>
    <p><b>Damian Vanta</b> is a <b>tiefling Oath of Preservation paladin</b>, raised as a <b>soldier</b> in a paladin order who fled to the new world after letting a combination of high expectations and inner conflict get the best of him. In Alto, he searches for allies in helping to protect Absolution, the last old world settlement of his kind, as well as finding a solution for the dark inheritance that plagues himself and all tieflings in Chorus.</p>
    <p><b>Helena Lukeg Bruenkirk</b> is a <b>salt dwarf College of Fates bard</b> who lost her career as a <b>tradesman</b> and was taken in by a traveling fortune teller during her search for continued employment. During her apprenticeship, she recieved an apocalyptic vision that shook her view of the world to its core. She would then set off believing that finding proof of such an event's approach would prove herself in the eyes of her mentor, potentially even helping to stop it... if only she could overcome a few vices in the process.</p>
    <p><b>Theodoros Neka</b> is a <b>human Gunner fighter</b>, a <b>fallen kingpin</b> who was once the heir to his mother's prospector empire, only to watch it be overthrown by her closest allies. He follows their trail to the new world hoping to reclaim what was meant to be his, only to find that the corruption and subversion of what his family had built runs much, much deeper than originally thought.</p>
    <p><b>Xanthian Ellamir</b> is an <b>eidolon Timekeeper sorcerer</b>, a former <b>noble</b> patriarch of a royal house of Norimar who sought the secrets of new world magic and ended up in much deeper than he wished--his soul torn from his body by tempomantic magic and transfigured into that of an eidolon. He now seeks a way to return to his former self, fearing he would be unable to reclaim his former position at the head of his house in his current state.</p>
    <p><b>Zimi Yathar</b> is an <b>elven School of Tempomancy wizard</b>, a self-made <b>sage</b> and daughter of an immensely-powerful archdruid who sought to break free from her destiny of becoming as her mother's successor. So intense and unbreakable was her resistance that, to ensure that she would be forced to adhere to her destiny, the mother took drastic action and 'cursed' Zimi with a divine power. She was then set free into the world to follow her wanderlust, with the specter of an inevitable future hanging over them both.</p>
    <p><b>Zyra Mae</b> is a <b>tenemann Mortal Divination mystic</b>--the first of a long line of powerful diviners who lived in a prehistorical empire. Her connection to tempomancy would lead her to being <b>temporally challenged</b>, dragged to the present day by modern mages, finding the world entirely different to what she left behind. Her place now unknown, she must decide if she wishes to reunite with her people in the present, or return to live out the life she had in the past. </p>
    <p>A lot of these subclasses, races, and backgrounds haven't been explained yet, but I will be doing such in the following updates.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

  <div class="card">
    <h2 style="text-align:center">Update 3: Rise, Mystic</h2>
    <h5 style="text-align:center">Claim the forces of death!</h5>
    <p>The Knight has been reborn as the Mystic, a full spellcaster who commands the forces of death and the spirits of the Ethereal. Though they are relatively rare in modern Chorus, they have been known to act as advisors and wise mediums for numerous leaders across time, their insights provided by the departed providing them with a unique outlook on life. They are set apart by a spell list comprised with little damaging abilities, but numerous control and area denial abilities. These spells can be augmented with Shadow Magic, allowing failed saving throws against crowd control to be converted into damage over time, and are complimented by a host of 'hauntings', which allows the mystic to conjure persisting areas of both helpful and harmful effects, allowing them an uncanny ability to lock down a battlefield while their allies move freely. Additionally, they have a measure of control over their own soul, allowing them to 'cheat death' in a unique way that has lasting consequences.</p>
    <p>Like the Augur and the Knight before it, the Mystic also comes with a set of subclasses, known as 'Occult Modi', which define how exactly they interact with the dead and change what deathly forces are available to them:</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p><b>Mortal Divination</b></p>
    <p><i>"Even with their soul having departed, the bones of the fallen carry a power unique to them that has been known to rouse the forces of death with notable potency. By fashioning bones into fetishes, totems, armor, or by simply using them as tools for divination, a mystic can call the attention of powerful specters to them, allowing them to draw on their power to act as an aspect of death itself, greatly increasing hardiness and martial prowess."</i></p>
    <p>These morose warriors adopt a level of martial prowess, allowing them to act as frontline fighters to a degree. They can also anchor their hauntings with totems of bone and wicker, allowing them to have greater radii and longer durations.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p><b>Enthenic Herblore</b></p>
    <p><i>"It is known that many herbal reagents found across Chorus can have mind-altering effects when consumed, which has lead to their use and abuse across time. Only the mystic knows the true potential behind them, and by burning them as incense or consuming them in very specific amounts, one's mind can be opened to communion with wild and druidic spirits, who have been known to pass on their knowledge and sway over the natural world to the mystic communing with them."</i></p>
    <p>These naturalists commune with spirits using mind-altering herbs and incenses, allowing them to commune with nature spirits easily and even invoke them as hauntings for a variety of effects unique to them.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p><b>Runic Infusion</b></p>
    <p><i>"A rune can hold very intense importance to singular beings, and even after death the presence of such runes can bind them to specific places or objects for centuries at a time. This is a known method of creating some types of sentient weapons, but a mystic is capable of seeing the true potential of their proper use, with some having been known to bind extremely powerful spirits to rune-imbued constructs, animating them according to their will."</i></p>
    <p>These unique 'smiths' can animate armor with the presences of spirits, granting them another hand in their conflicts and a much more mobile source of haunting effects.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p><b>Tarotic Cartomancy</b></p>
    <p><i>"A common method of divination employed by career diviners is that of the tarot, a set of cards whose faces carry specific meanings and connections to certain spiritual and divine concepts. Flashy, but woefully impotent when in the hands of magicians and tricksters. Mystics have been known to employ the tarot when contacting the dead, although when used outside of strictly divination, results can vary as much as shuffling of a deck of cards can, leading to chaotic outcomes."</i></p>
    <p>Using the tarot to commune with spirits, these mystics leave their abilities to the whims of fate, making them unpredicatble and efficient in their invocation of death.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Update 2: The Knight's Days are Numbered</h2>
    <h5 style="text-align:center">But It's Mechanics Will Live On</h5>

    
    <p>In the previous update, I talked about sweeping changes to the book that are occurring as a result of my dissatisfaction of the setting. This time, I'm going to talk about another pain point related to these changes: The Knight. In the previous setting, the Knight existed as a sort of binding force for the unraveling societies of Kaz Ranar, a champion whose entire purpose was to be a force for others to rally behind, to the point where they even at one point had a class resource called 'Influence'. With the changes to the setting, this has begun to come into question.</p>
    <p>As the apocalypse is no longer current, the differences between the Knight and classes such as the Fighter or Ranger have begun to blur, putting into question whether or not it should continue to have a place in the book. At the moment, I am erring on the side of no, and the more I consider it the more I fall further onto that side. The banner system, while unique, was simply a thin sheet draped over what would otherwise be an augmented form of a Battle Master Fighter. And I think the biggest issue I'm having here is the fact that the Knight was somewhat anchored in the idea of it being a martial class--at the end of the day, the concept of manipulating the battlefield through a semi-mobile source of AOE buffs and debuffs is cool, but difficult to implement when you are also expected to dish out decent amounts of damage. You know, like how one would when attempting to fulfill the fantasy of a Knight?</p>
    <p>To be honest, the current iteration of the Knight derives from a class concept I wrote several years ago, and was the initial spark that prompted me wanting to write the book. And while it will be sad to rip out those roots of the project, I feel like it must be done to maintain a cohesive theme and setting.</p>
    <p>My ideas in changing the Knight have boiled down to a class which currently has no name. Names such as 'Shaman', 'Caller', 'Emissary', 'Thaumaturge', 'Mystic', Theurgist', etc. have rolled around in my head, and I have yet to settle on one. Regardless, this new iteration of the class will be similar to the Knight in that its main class gimmick will be to manipulate a number of AOE effects that will allow them to either impose powerful effects onto allies or enemies, or corral these enemies so they are easier for the class to clean up with its extensive spell list (also mostly AOE abilities.) In theme, it derives these abilities from being a sort of spirit medium, calling upon the spirits of the departed to lend their strength in Material, in exchange for the chance of being finally sent to their proper afterlife.</p>
    <p>Other ideas included a runesmith and a smashing-together of the Knight and Augur, but I think the first one lends the most credence. Once I have a full concept thrown together (and have decided on a name, hur hur), this class will have an update of its own to fully outline its fantasy. If it's ready by next week, I'll talk about it then. If not, I'll probably be talking about something else I'm including in the rewrite... premade charaters.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Update 1: A Rebranding</h2>
    <h5 style="text-align:center">Some Much Needed Changes</h5>

    
    <p>Hi! It's been a while. A good, long while. Going on half of a year, actually.</p>
    <p>I apologize for the extreme lack of updates on my part--frankly unacceptable behavior from someone trying to get people excited about a product, huh? I sincerely apologize to anyone still around waiting for updates (don't worry, I'll be getting back into the swing of things starting with this post).</p>
    <p>There was a bit of a spell where there was some really weird mental health stuff going on on my end; another (entirely unrelated) project of mine ended up being shelved for the time being because I just needed some time to settle into my new job and get the spiders out of my head. But the whole time, I've still been working on the book...</p>
    <p>...although when I start showing you things, you might find that it's in a bit of a different state than you might remember.</p>
    <p>As I continued to work on the book, I was somewhat dissatisfied with how things were coming together. The scope was too large, the overarching themes a bit too vague. As I mused, it started to feel to me like the whole setting was just dressing; an excuse for me to get the mechanical aspects of the book out in a fashion that I felt like people might be interested in. And as I continued to think and muse, I decided that wasn't how I wanted my beautiful child of a literary work to enter the world in.</p>
    <p>I've been experimenting with other ideas on how to have the setting better stand on its own, including sweeping changes to the setting and overall theme. One that has gained traction among personal confidants is (working title) <b>Chorus: A Navigator's Account of the New World</b>. The current setting of Kaz Ranar is made much larger (the 'old world') and set off as a background location, and the focus of the book instead takes place in a region of a recently-discovered continent named 'Alto', wherein old world powers attempt to gain a foothold (out of necessity, there's a bit of a resource shortage in the old world which rings similar bells to the Flood of Chaos in the old book concept) in the face of adversity from hostile environments, creatures, and native populations.</p>
    <p>Personally, I like the direction that the change in setting is going--the constricted scope makes every location much more impactful, while the change to a colonial setting still allows the diverse host of cultures I wrote to still have a place. The more mechanical parts of the book are mostly unchanged, though some minor things needed to be retooled as the lack of apocalypse meant that there wasn't really a need for a bunch of grimdark edgelord subclasses. I'm open to critique and ideas regarding the new setting; I'm not sure how many of you showed up specifically for the post-apocalyptic setting, but I'm hoping to fit as much of what I had before into the new setting.</p>
    <p>Of course, I'll need to throw together new promotional material whenever I decide on a title (open to suggestions by the way), and of course the page on the website is going to be a pain to redo, but hopefully the changes I'm writing ease my concerns over the setting being 'wide as an ocean, shallow as a puddle'.</p>
    <p>With this update, I'll be getting back into my weekly schedule, as well as contuing to work on promoting the project to hopefully get more activity into the Discord. Thank you so much for continuing to stick around! I won't promise a date as of now for an updated Kickstarter campaign, but as always, you'll be the first to know.</p>
    <p>I'll leave you for now with two descriptions of new backgrounds I've added to the book as part of the rewrite.</p>
    <p><a href="arcanist.PNG" target="_blank">The Arcanist background. Researchers of magic and the multiverse with a penchant for recognizing more subtle arcane influences.</a></p>
    <p><a href="newblood.PNG" target="_blank">The Newblood background. No life experience prior to their adventure, but a powerful potential that provides unique opportunities.</a></p>
